                <p>
                    <b>Visertisements</b> is an advertisement system for non-commercial visual novels.
                    It does not cost money to join, and no one is making money from having it on their site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It takes inspiration from
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://john.citrons.xyz/">johnvertisement</a>
                    and

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The game can contain adult and sensitive content, but the advertisement shouldn't.
